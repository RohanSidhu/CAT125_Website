## What is that? 
Object oriented programming is a programming design where we have these objects when working with our code. These objects can hold different methods, attributes, and data exclusive to that object. 

This site has *all* the essentials you need in getting started understanding object oriented programming. 

Check out the *Learn* tab to understand what exactly is Object Oriented Programming with a neat example!

The *Links* tab provides useful resources that I personally have used through my undergraduate career. There are also sample projects that you can try out on your own to test your knowledge with Object Oriented Programming!
