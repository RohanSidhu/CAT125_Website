[Geeks for Geeks][1] is a website that explores various computer science topics. They offer a range of interview questions, videos, and sample code for others to see. 

I personally have used Geeks for Geeks in the past and I do appreciate the amount of work and effort that is put into the maintenance of the website. However, there are a few flaws that I personally find troubling.

## First: Lack of Context
Relative to other sites, this site does not provide any context with what the topic is about. They just dive into the topic, which may make it difficult for other readers to follow.

When creating a guide, it is imperative that the author explain what the concept is about, down to the level where anyone can understand it. 

Geeks for Geeks's audience is experienced programmers, hence I do not believe that this may be an appropriate site when beginning learn Object Oriented Programming. 

However, do know that this site is useful in its own ways! I personally have used this site when I needed a refresher on topics that I haven't seen in a while.

## Second: Over Doing It
When explaining the premise of Object Oriented programming, Geek for Geeks begin to explain everything. The go over Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, and others all in one go. 

This becomes a little overwhelming for the reader as there is this splurge of information. 

When discussing this information, it is crucial that the reader understand everything, however, it should be broken into pieces and chunks so the reader can have a sense of flow in the guide.  

## Third: No Other Sources to Learn More
All of the material on the website is good content, however, how is the reader supposed to gain more information and have a further understanding?

The last problem that I see with this guide is how there aren't many resources that they offer to seek further information. 

Having other resources allow the reader to explore and figure out more about certain topics, such as encapsulation, on their own if needed. The lack of resources make it difficult for the reader to have a complete understanding if they are not able to understand the information on their first pass. 

## Overall...
this website is useful! As mentioned previously, I used this website to study for interviews and brush up on certain key concepts. However, for a complete beginner, I suggest visiting a different site.

I would suggest this site for individuals who have coded before and have experience in programming.
