Hover over the links bar above, the dropbox will provide you some sites that I personally find useful! 

These links vary from a specific MIT lecture about Object Oriented Programming to fun games like Lightbot. 

If you want to visit the websites, make sure you click on the "Click Here!" right below the pictures.
