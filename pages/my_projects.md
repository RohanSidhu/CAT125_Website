Each of these projects below me all involved Object Oriented Programming! They were super fun when designing and I have learned so much through these projects.

The first one on the left is called CrazyOrbs! This game allows a user to click on the plane and place these dynamically changing orbs. These orbs change colors, can be moved around, and can shrink/enlarge at different speeds.

The second one is on the right, on the top. This project is about having multiple objects and creating simple pictures with them. This one is a cityscape that uses rectangles, triangles, and circles to create the picture. 

The last one is on the bottom right. This project was fairly simple and one of the one of beginning projects I completed. The user can click on the canvas and it will spawn a mickey silhouette. It is draggable and disappears if the user takes the mouse away from the canvas.
