Each of these projects below me all involved Object Oriented Programming! They were super fun when designing and I have learned so much through these projects.

## CrAzY OrBs
The first one on the left is called CrazyOrbs! This game allows a user to click on the plane and place these dynamically changing orbs. These orbs change colors, can be moved around, and can shrink/enlarge at different speeds.

This entire program was written in Java and utilized Java GUI components and event handlers. I spent approximately two weeks on this project, developing my object oriented programming understanding. 

## Geometry
The second one is on the right, on the top. This project is about having multiple objects and creating simple pictures with them. This one is a cityscape that uses rectangles, triangles, and circles to create the picture. 

This was just a sample picture that was created, since the code only created the shapes, I am able to create other shapes too like reconstructing the mickey mouse silhouette. 

The different shape objects that I had were:
* Rectangle 
* Circle
* Line 
* Triangle 

## Mickey Mouse
The last one is on the bottom right. This project was fairly simple and one of the first projects I completed. The user can click on the canvas and it will spawn a mickey silhouette. It is draggable and disappears if the user takes the mouse away from the canvas.

It is unable to be seen through the picture, but if the user was to drag the mickey across the screen, it also changes color and moves with the mouse!
