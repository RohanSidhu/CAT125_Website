I am a student at the University of California, San Diego pursing a Mathematics and Computer Science Degree. I personally had limited experience with coding when I walked it, making it difficult to navigate through my courses. 

Over time, I found a plethora of resources, some of which can be found under the *Links* tab. I slowly became better at coding and have ever since adapted to the Object Oriented design.

Now I am currently learning and investigating other design patterns to branch out and learn other styles of programming!

## My Experience 
Recently, I have completed an internship at this small company called PVNet. I worked on a project with small group of eight other individuals. We developed this application for students in school on Magic Leap One, an augmented reality headset.

I was able to enhance my Object Oriented Programming skills by using a different language, C#. I have never worked with C# before, however, it does resemble Java and C++ making it easy to pick up.
