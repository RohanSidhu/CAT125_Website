I am a student at the University of California, San Diego pursing a Mathematics and Computer Science Degree. After taking my lower division computer science course, I've learned that I am a slow learner and needed other material beside a textbook to teach me information. 

All of the languages that I've learned were Object Oriented, hence I decided to make a website explaining it all! I remember struggling with Java as I had no idea what an object was. My TA's knew me by name because of how much helped I've needed. This website is a miniature guide for individuals who are learning about Object Oriented Programming!
