Lightbot is an online game where the user has to make the robot light up blue tiles. This game is nice as it encourages one to be careful about how they construct the logic. There is no explicit coding here.

This game is a nice introduction into understanding what objects are, how they communicate with others, and how important it is to have precise logic in code.
