Codecademy is known for creating hundreds of tutorials on nearly all programming languages. Linked above is the tutorial for Java, a tutorial that I took prior to taking my first computer science course.

I personally like this website as they are able to provide users an online coding environment. It allows users to see, in real time, what their code is doing.
