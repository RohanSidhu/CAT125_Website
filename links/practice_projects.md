These projects are from my first computer science course at UC-San Diego. This professor has been teaching for several years at UC-San Diego and his projects help one learn core concepts through the Java programming language. 

The projects get increasingly difficult over each of the different programming assignments. Each programming assignment also has a new feature not used in any other assignment.
